**[\*\*\* We are calling for expressions of interest in the ITiCSE
leadership for 2022.

The Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education conference
(ITiCSE) is a SIGCSE conference that has been held annually since 1996,
in late June or early July. It has been held in many different countries
(see list below). Attendance regularly exceeds 200. This conference
brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing
issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, paper,
panel, poster and \"tips & techniques\" sessions, the conference
provides facilities and exposure for working groups of up to ten
members, whose final reports may be published by SIGCSE. Exhibits and
tutorials are also offered. Plus good food, good company and interesting
locales. If you have never been to an ITiCSE, do yourself a favor and
go. You will not regret it!
