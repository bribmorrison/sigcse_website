The Conference Chair was John Gorgone (Bentley College). Maynard
Mansfield and Robert Barrett (both from Indiana University -- Purdue
University at Fort Wayne) served as Program Co-Chairs. John Schrage
(Southern Illinois University -- Edwardsville) was Chair of Panels; Don
Chand (Bentley College) was Chair for Case Studies and Tutorials; Dennis
Anderson (Bentley College) was Treasurer; and S. Srinivasan helped with
Local Arrangements.

A total of 181 papers were submitted with 60 accepted (33% acceptance
rate) and there were 14 panels and 2 workshops.

The 1989 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was
awarded to **Edsger Dijkstra** for providing clarity about programs
through his letter **\"GOTO Considered Harmful\"** and writings on
structured programming and the effects of these works on the emergence
of formal methods as integral to computer science education.

There were also elections, but the entire same Board was elected, so
they must have been doing an excellent job! Continuing as Chair was
Elliot Koffman (Temple University); Vice-Chair was Nell Dale (University
of Texas at Austin); Secretary/Treasurer was Robert Cupper (Allegheny
College). The Board of Directors continued to be: Lillian Cassel
(Villanova University), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce
Currie Little (Towson State University).

James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued as the
Editor of the Bulletin.
