The 5th Roundtable for Department Chairs was held March 10, 2010 and was
led by Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University), Sandra DeLoatch
(Norfolk State University), Frank Friedman (Temple University), and
Dianne Martin (George Washington University)

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Sally Fincher**, for outstanding contributions to computing
education research and inspiring a generation of computing education
researchers.

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to
**Peter J. Denning**, for forty years of exceptional service in industry
and academia that stimulated a combined synergy which promoted
educational excellence in software engineering and computing curricula.

ITiCSE\
The 15th ITiCSE conference was held June 26-30 at Bilkent, Ankara,
Turkey. Conference chairs were Reyan Ayfer, Bilkent University, Turkey
and John Impagliazzo, Qatar University, Qatar. The Program Chair was
Cary Laxer, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, USA. There were 117
paper submissions with 60 accepted (51.3% acceptance rate). There were
190 attendees and 8 working groups. The ITiCSE 2009 dinner was held on a

ICER\
The 6th ICER was held August 9-10, 2010 in Aarhus, Denmark. There was
another change in the leadership structure with the previous conference
chair staying as Past Chair, the current site, and the future site.
Again, the local person took care of the local arrangements, but
officially all three were conference and program chairs: Michael
Caspersen (University of Aarhus), Kathryn Sanders (Rhode Island College)
and Michael Clancy (University of California Berkeley). There were 38
papers submitted with 12 accepted (32% acceptance rate). There were 38
attendees.

Since 2008, the ICER Fool\'s Award has been given for the paper with the
most interesting idea and/or most potential for impact on CS education
and CS Education research. This year\'s winners were Orni
Meerbaum-Salant, Michal Armoni, and Mordechai (moti) Ben-Ari for their
paper Learning Computer Science Concepts with Scratch. Among other
things, the paper introduces the idea of integrating the SOLO taxonomy
and Bloom\'s taxonomy as orthogonal taxonomies. Most people in the
audience were captured by the idea, which seems very promising and
useful. Picture of author in viking hat with horns.

The 14th Doctoral Consortium was held on August 8th in Aarhus with Lauri
Malmi (Aalto University) leading the efforts.

The March 2010 (Volume 42, Issue 1) brought a new format to the Bulletin
- a newsletter format. Here\'s a snapshot of the SIGCSE membership from

Did you know that SIGCSE used to have several listservs? From The
Bulletin (Vol. 42, No. 2, June 2010) in addition to the two we have now
(SIGCSE-ANNOUNCE and SIGCSE-MEMBERS) we also had SIGCSE-COMMITTEES,
SIGCSE-MATH-COMM, SIGCSE-FACULTY-EVAL, SIGCSE-WOMEN-COMM and SIGCSE-CRM.
As use within each declined or the sub-committees finished their work
they were discontinued.
