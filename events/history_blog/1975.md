The 5th Technical Symposium was held February 20-21, 1975 in Washington,
D.C. The Conference Chair was Gerald Engel from Virginia Institute of
Marine Science. Program chairs were Bruce Barnes (NSF), Norm Gibbs
(College of William and Mary), Susan Gerhart (Duke University), Andrew
Molnar (NSF), Glenn Ingram (NIE), Joyce Little (Community College of
Baltimore), C.K. Capstick (University of Guelph), Harris Burns
(Randolph-Macon College), Richard Austing (University of Maryland), and
Larry John (University of Dayton). There were just over 300 attendees.
Sadly, there seems to be no record of this event in the Digital Library.

In 1975 a new slate of officers was elected. Richard Austing was
re-elected to the Chair Position. Douglas Kerr was the Vice-Chair, and
John Dalphin served as Secretary/Treasurer. Board Members included Barry
Bateman for a second term, Robert Aiken, and Elliott Organick. Della
Bonnette continued as the Bulletin Editor and continued to be assisted
by John Dalphin.\
