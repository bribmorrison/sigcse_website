The SIGCSE Symposium 2013 Best Paper Award was presented to Leo Porter,

The theme of the symposium was \"The Changing Face of Computing\". For
the first time at SIGCSE, there was a movie shown following the Thursday
night reception, \"CODEBREAKER\"
([www.turingfilm.com](http://www.turingfilm.com)). The movie describes
the remarkable and tragic story of Alan Turing, one of the 20th
century\'s most important people. The Executive Producer of this
drama-documentary participated in a Q&A session following the movie. A
very popular feature of recent Technical Symposiums, the \"puzzle
extravaganza\" started this year.
