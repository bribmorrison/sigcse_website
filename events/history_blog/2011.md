was led by Sandra DeLoatch (Norfolk State University), Frank Friedman
(Temple University), and Dianne Martin (George Washington University).

The conference theme was Reaching Out was reflected in Matthias
Felleisen\'s talk, \"Teach Scheme!\", Susan Landau\'s talk, \"A Computer
Scientist Goes to Washington: How to be Effective in a World Where Facts
Are Only 10% of the Equation,\" and Luis von Ahn\'s talk, \"Three Human
Computation Projects\" which received a rare standing ovation. In honor
of our Texas location, we added the \"Robot Hoedown and Rodeo\" with
\"trail bosses\" Jennie Kay and Tom Lauwers, featuring a grand finale of
40 line-dancing robots!

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Matthias Felleisen for the creation of a design-focused
introductory curriculum, for educational outreach programs for K-12, and
for many PhD students who continue to merge programming language
research and education.

Barbara Boucher Owens and Henry Walker were elevated to Queen Barbara
and Sir Henry, Grand Duke of Castle Auerbach, ending an enjoyable and
relaxed conference. (The Bulletin, Vol. 43, No. 3, September 2011).
