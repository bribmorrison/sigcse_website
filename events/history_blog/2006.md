The 37th Technical Symposium was held March 1-5, 2006 in Houston, Texas.
The Conference Chairs were Douglas Baldwin (SUNY at Geneseo) and Paul
Tymann (Rochester Institute of Technology). The Program Chairs were
Susan Haller (SUNY Potsdam) and Ingrid Russell (University of Hartford).
294 papers submitted, with 104 accepted, for a 35% acceptance rate.
There were 1245 attendees (identical to previous year!)

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Richard Pattis** for more than two decades of innovation and
influence in providing thoughtful, profound, and concrete examples of
teaching and thinking about algorithmic problem solving and programming.

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to
**Joyce Currie Little** in honor of her service on the SIGCSE Board, the
ACM Education Board, numerous conference committees; and for her
contributions to computing in two year colleges, to certification and to
professionalism in the discipline.

At the 2006 Symposium the first Roundtable for Department Chairs was
held on March 1st. Leading the effort were Sandra DeLoatch (Norfolk
State University), Sue Fitzgerald (Metropolitan State University), and
Frank Young (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology).

SIGCSE and CSTA have worked to collaborate on areas of common interest.
For example, Robb Cutler, CSTA Chair, and Chris Stephenson, CSTA
Executive Director, gave the Friday keynote at SIGCSE 2006 on "Working
Together to Improve K-12 Computer Science Education".

The 9th Doctoral Consortium was held on March 1st co-located with the
Symposium. Leading the DC this year were Mark Guzdial (Georgia Institute
of Technology) and Orit Hazzan (Technion-Israel Institute of
Technology). Discussants included Richard Anderson (University of
Washington at Seattle), Philip East (University of Northern Iowa), and
Josh Tenenberg (University of Washington, Tacoma). From Cecily Heiner we
have a picture of the 2006 DC participants:\

An interesting tidbit on what the organization was up to during the
year:

-   During the spring (Northern Hemisphere), a new committee was formed:
    Committee on Models for Evaluating Faculty Scholarship. (Volume 38,
    Issue 2, June 2006 Inroads)
-   Plagiarism, including self-plagiarism was a big topic of Volume 38,
    Issue 4, December 2006 Inroads
