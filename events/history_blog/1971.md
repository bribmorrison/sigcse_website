There was no Technical Symposium held during 1971, instead it was moved
to the early months of the following year (February/March) which has
been fairly constant since that time. SIGCSE did get a new slate of
officers in 1971: Aaron Finerman was Chair, Tom Kurtz was Vice-Chair,
and David Matula continued as Secretary/Treasurer. Board members
included Robert Aiken, Peter Denning, and Richard Hamming. Robert Aiken
continued to serve as the Bulletin Editor. (Briana Morrison)
