The year is 2004 and we elected a new Board. Elected Chair was Henry
Walker (Grinnell College). Elected Vice-Chair was Barbara Boucher Owens
(Southwestern University). Sally Fincher (University of Kent) was
elected Secretary and Vicki Almstrum (University of Texas at Austin) was
elected Treasurer. Elected as At Large Board members were Dan Joyce
(Villanova University), RenÃ©e McCauley (College of Charleston), Alison
Young (Unitec Institute of Technology, Auckland) and Brue Klein (Grand
Valley State University) continued as Past Chair. The Bulletin Editor
continued to be John Impagliazzo (Hofstra University).

The 35th Technical Symposium was held March 3-7, 2004 in Norfolk, VA.
The Conference Chairs were Daniel Joyce (Villanova University) and

Dan Joyce provided this photo from Norfolk with the following story: \"I
took that from the stage during my \"welcome to Norfolk\" intro to the
conference saying I promised my kids I would send them a picture of my
friends. Included in the front you can see my co-chair Deb Knox and the
Program Chairs Tom Naps and Wanda Dann.\"

There were 320 papers submitted, with 90 accepted (28% acceptance rate)
and there were 1228 attendees.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Mordechai Ben-Ari** for his contributions as a textbook
author, mentor and pedagogical researcher at both the university and
pre-college levels, in concurrency, formal methods, and programming
languages. Moti couldn\'t attend the conference, so the keynote was
actually delivered by Owen Astrachan (Duke University) and featured a
great game of identifying people from their pictures.

Oral History Project here:

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Bruce
Klein to recognize him for exemplary service to ACM, extraordinary
commitment to SIGCSE, and mentoring of SIGCSE members. He served on ACM
SIG Board task forces, the ACM Education Board, the SIGCSE Executive
Board 2001 to 2007 as chair and past chair, was a past ITiCSE Conference
and Technical Symposium chair, and multiple program committees.

The 7th Doctoral Consortium was held at SIGCSE on March 3rd in Norfolk,
VA and the Chairs were Sue Fitzgerald (Metropolitan State University)
and Todd Stevens (Radford University).

The 9th ITiCSE was held June 28-30, 2004 at the University of Leeds in
the United Kingdom. Roger Boyle (University of Leeds) was the Conference
Chair. Martyn Clark (University of Leeds) and Amruth Kumar (Ramapo
College of New Jersey) were the Program Co-Chairs. There were over 153
papers submitted with 46 accepted (

In Volume 36, Issue 2, June 2004 issue of The Bulletin, Chair Henry
Walker wrote the following, most of which is still true today:

> The SIGCSE Board formally approves event sites. For ITiCSE, interested
> SIGCSE members initiate proposals for holding conferences at their
> universities in Europe, and SIGCSE representatives .. work with local
> leaders to refine site details. In contrast, SIGCSE chooses locations
> for its symposia in the US through a bidding process, coordinated by
> ACM staff and a SIGCSE volunteer. For all events, the SIGCSE Board
> devotes considerable attention to finding appropriate facilities at
> costs that seem within reach of SIGCSE members. Unfortunately, this
> eliminates many initial proposals (particularly from hotels and
> convention centers at numerous well-known cities in the United
> States).

In the same issue is an interesting tribute to Anita Borg along with a
transcript of an interview with her.
