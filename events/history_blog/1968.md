The year is 1968. A group of computing educators met at the Fall Joint
Computer Conference (FJCC) in Las Vegas to write and sign a petition
that eventually led to the creation of SIGCSE. Elliot Irving Organick
(1925 -- 1985) is credited with being the driving force behind the
group. The petition was signed by 20 ACM members, including Bob Aiken.
