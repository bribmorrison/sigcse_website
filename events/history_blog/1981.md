1981 brought several now-familiar elements to our organization. It was
the first year the Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science
Education award was given out, and it went to William Atchison, the Head
of ACM Curriculum Committee that produced Curriculum \'68, and a
founding leader of University of Maryland Computer Science Department.
Here's the announcement from the Bulletin:

In 1981 we elected a new Board: Norman Gibbs (who moved to Arizona State
University) as Chair, Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern
Louisiana) as Vice-Chair, John Frederick Schrage (Southern Illinois
University -- Edwardsville) for Secretary. At-Large members elected were
Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee), Nell Dale (University of Texas
at Austin) and Joyce Currie Little (Community College of Baltimore).

The 12th Technical Symposium was held February 26-27, 1981 in St. Louis,
MO. The Conference Chair was Kenneth Magel (University of Missouri at
Rolla). The Program Chairs were Frank G. Walters (University of Missouri
at Rolla) and Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin). There were 62
papers submitted with 46 accepted giving a 71.2% acceptance rate.

There were many changes made to the Technical Symposium based on
feedback from the previous ones. This Technical Symposium introduced
some of our now well-known conference features: tutorials, workshops,
Birds of a Feather, and Panel Sessions. These were all explicitly stated
in the call for scholarship.
