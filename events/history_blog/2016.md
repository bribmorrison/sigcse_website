The 2nd New Educators Workshop was co-located with the Technical
Symposium and was held March 2, 2016. At the helm were David Reed
(Creighton University) and Andrea Danyluk (Williams College).

The 21st ITiCSE conference was held July 11-13, 2016 for the first time
in South America, in Arequipa, Peru. The Conference Chairs were Ernesto
Cuardros-Vargas (UCSP, Peru) and Alison Clear (Eastern Institute of
Technology). The Program Chairs were Janet Carter (University of Kent)
and Yvan Tupac (San Pablo Catholic University). There were 147 papers
submitted with 56 accepted (38% acceptance rate) and 186 people
attended. There were seven working groups.

The 12th ICER conference was held September 9-11, 2016 in Melbourne,
Australia. The local arrangements were made by Judy Sheard (Monash
University). The Conference and Program Chairs were Brian Dorn
(University of Nebraska at Omaha), Judy Sheard (Monash University) and
Josh Tenenberg and Donald Chinn (University of Washington Tacoma).
Donald was learning how to do the local arrangements as were in the
planning stages of separating the ICER leadership from Past - Current -
Future to Site and Program chairs. There were 102 papers submitted with
26 accepted (25% acceptance rate) and 105 people attended.

The Chairs' Best Paper Award was presented to Alex Lishinski, Aman
Yadav, Jon Good, and Richard Enbody, from Michigan State University, and
the John Henry award to Elizabeth Patitsas, Jesse Berlin, Michelle
Craig, and Steve Easterbrook from University of Toronto. Picture of

The John Henry Award for the paper that in the judgement of the
conference participants attempts a task that may seem impossible and
pushes "the upper limits of our pedagogy" was presented to Elizabeth
Patitsas, Jesse Berlin, Michelle Craig, and Steve Easterbrook from the
University of Toronto for their paper "Evidence that Computer Science
Grades are not Bimodal". As is traditional with this award Elizabeth was
presented with a "typical" local hat, an Australian bushman's hat --
complete with swinging corks.

The 20th Doctoral Consortium was co-located with ICER and held on
September 8, 2016. Leading the efforts were Anthony Robins (University
of Otago) and Ben Shapiro (University of Colorado, Boulder). The
discussants were Katrina Falkner (University of Adelaide), Steve Cooper
(University of Nebraska, Lincoln), Kristin Searle (Utah State
University), Aman Yadav (Michigan State University), and Christopher
Hundhausen (Washington State University) for the 17 participants.\

The Bulletin (Vol. 48, No. 2, April 2016) contained an article by
Michael Casperson explaining the \"Improved Reviewing Process for the
SIGCSE Technical Symposium\". Most conferences have a Program Committee
(PC) with personally invited members (typically in the range of 25\--50
people). The setup for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is radically
different with a huge pool of âˆ¼1,000 volunteers serving as reviewers.
