The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Andrew Tannenbaum** for seminal textbooks in networks,
computer organization and operating systems, outstanding wit and
educational leadership.

It was in 1997 that the **SIGCSE Award for Lifetime Service to the
Computer Science Education Community** was established. This award
honors an individual who has a long history of volunteer service to the
computer science education community. The service is not limited to
SIGCSE service and may take many forms, such as professional society
leadership, conference organization, outreach efforts, editorial board
participation, or any of a number of other types of service to the
computer science education community. The award may recognize service at
any level (K-12, college, graduate, or continuing post-college).

The First Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education Award was
bestowed upon **Dick Austing** who was editor on several curriculum
recommendation documents in almost every area of computer science,
including Curriculum \'78, 2-year Task Force Report. He also served as
registrar for many SIGCSE conferences both before and after computerized
registration. He served as the SIGCSE Technical Symposium chair and was
a founding ACM Fellow.
