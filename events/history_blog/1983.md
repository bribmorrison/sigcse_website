In February 17-18, 1983 the 14th Technical Symposium was held in
Orlando, FL. The Conference Chair was Larry Cottrell (University of
Central Florida). The Program Chairs were A. Joe Turner (Clemson
University) and Sheau-Dong Lang (University of Central Florida). There
were 84 papers submitted with 59 accepted, yielding a 70.2% acceptance
rate.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded
to Karl Karlstrom (Prentice-Hall) for being a book editor who piloted
some 500 books on computer science through the publication process at a
time when a senior editor said, \"I have traveled the length and breadth
of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you
that data processing is a fad that won\'t last out the year.\" If you
want to read his remarks, check out the June 1983 issue of the Bulletin
