James Miller (University of West Florida) began his first of eight terms
as the Bulletin Editor.

On February 11-12, 1982 the 13th Technical Symposium was held in
Indianapolis, IN. The Conference Chair was John Dalphin, (Indiana
University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne). The Program Chairs were
Robert A. Barrett (Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne)
and John T. Gorgone (Bentley College). There was a 69.3% acceptance rate
with 75 papers submitted and 52 accepted. There were 429 pre-registered
participants.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education award was
given to Alan Perlis (Yale University) for contributions to education,
especially through his work on programming languages and compiler
construction. Pretty cool that the inaugural Turing Award winner was the
2nd SIGCSE award winner! Wish I could have heard that keynote!
