There were 175 papers submitted, and 60 accepted for 34.3% acceptance
rate. There were 11 panels, 1 special session and 43 posters. Attendance
for the conference was 734.

The theme for the conference was "Education, Research, Industry: Keep
the Information Flowing." Key notes were given by David Gries (Cornell
University) and William Wulf (University of Virginia).

The Friday luncheon was held again, with over 400 people in attendance
(Bulletin, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 1991). This article, by out-going
chair Elliot Koffman also mentions the growth of the Saturday workshops.
The dues for the following year were increased to \$16.50. SIGCSE
Membership was, and still is, a bargain!

In the December, 1991 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 23, Issue 4), new
Chair Nell Dale noted that SIGCSE had the highest member retention rate
(92%) of any of the ACM SIGs! SIGCSE had approximately 2600 members.
This issue also includes detailed minutes of several Board Meetings.
