**SIGCSE Bulletin and Inroads Promoted to Magazine Status**\
The former SIGCSE Bulletin inroads has been promoted from a SIGCSE
newsletter to a magazine, ACM Inroads! Over the years, SIGCSE\'s
quarterly publication evolved from an informal gathering of news and
ideas to a venue for columns, articles, research announcements,
editorials, etc. However, the former SIGCSE Bulletin inroads was not
identified as having an established review process (beyond the editor)
and thus was classified as a newsletter. Under the insightful guidance
of current Editor-in-Chief, John Impagliazzo, the new ACM Inroads will
offer somewhat expanded content and a new reviewing process. Altogether,
ACM and SIGCSE will now be supporting at least 3 levels of publications
for computing education:

-   [ACM Transactions on Computing Education](https://dl.acm.org/journal/toce) (formerly JERIC): all
    articles formally refereed following a feedback process.
-   [ACM Inroads](http://inroads.acm.org/) (formerly the SIGCSE Bulletin inroads): all articles
    reviewed or formally reviewed -- a step up from the expectations
    for a SIG newsletter.
-   [SIGCSE Bulletin]({{"/about/bulletin.html"|absolute_url}}): a new newsletter intended to bring members SIG
    news, together with SIGCSE conference proceedings on CD.
