Each of the following publications are available free to SIGCSE members
in the [ACM Digital Library](http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm):

*[ACM Inroads](http://inroads.acm.org/)* (2010 to present) quarterly
magazine:

-   \"Paving the Way Toward Excellence in Computing Education\"
-   The consistent high quality of *inroads* (see *SIGCSE Bulletin*
    below) led to the approval by the ACM Publications Board for SIGCSE
    to transition *inroads* to ACM magazine status beginning in 2010.
-   SIGCSE sponsors *[ACM Inroads](http://inroads.acm.org/)* and pays production costs for the magazine. A subscription is included as a member benefit. However, the ACM Publications Board is the entity directly responsible for the publication. For example, the editors are appointed by the ACM Publications Board.

*[SIGCSE Bulletin]({{"/about/bulletin.html"|absolute_url}})* (1969 to present) quarterly
newsletter:

-   Evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for
    columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements,
    editorials, etc.
-   Includes all *SIGCSE Symposium Proceedings* from 1970 (the 1st
    Symposium) through 2009 (the 40th Symposium)
-   Includes all *ITiCSE Conference Proceedings* and reviewed & accepted
    Working Group reports from 1996 (the 1st Conference) through 2009
    (the 19th Conference)
-   Adopted the tag name *inroads* between 1997 and 2009 during which
    time the name *inroads* is synonymous with *SIGCSE Bulletin*
-   In 2010, with the inception of *ACM Inroads* magazine, this publication
    reverted to being simply called the *Bulletin*, and was transformed
    into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing
    communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing
    events, and highlighting topics of interest

*[Technical Symposium]({{"/events/symposia/index.html"|absolute_url}}) Proceedings* - 1970 to
present

-   The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among
    educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing
    programs, curricula, and courses.
-   The Proceedings typically includes all papers plus summaries of
    panels, special sessions, workshops and posters.

*[ITiCSE Conference]({{"/events/iticse/index.html"|absolute_url}}) Proceedings* - 1996 to
present

-   ITiCSE has been held annually in June in or around Europe
    since 1996. This conference brings together delegates from all over
    the world to address pressing issues in computing education.
-   The Proceedings typically includes all papers plus summaries of
    panels, tips & techniques, workshops, posters, and working group
    topics.

*[ICER Conference]({{"/events/icer.html"|absolute_url}}) Proceedings* - 2005 to present

-   The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference
    aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing
    education research discipline. It has been held annually since 2005
    at sites around the world.

*[CompEd Conference]({{"/events/comped/index.html"|absolute_url}}) Proceedings* - from 2019

-   ACM Global Computing Education Conference (CompEd) is SIGCSE's new,
    fourth conference. This conference will be held starting in 2019 for
    initially three offerings and will run every other year. In general,
    the conference should run in countries where we do not regularly
    hold SIGCSE conferences, so not in North America or Europe.
